        "text": "Parents need to know that Toca Life World: Build Stories combines all the apps in the Toca Life series in one place. The free download comes with eight locations and 39 characters already installed. There's a large variety of in-app purchases -- ranging in price from $.99 to $13.99 -- to add more locations and characters, and the shopping cart icon is prominently displayed at all times. If you've already purchased other Toca Life apps, you can import them into Toca Life World: Build Stories for free. As with all the apps in the series, play is open-ended and involves kids moving characters and objects around different locations. Some areas have a Record option that allows kids to record their voice as they move things around and narrate a story; for that option, the app asks for permission to access your device's microphone. Parents can turn off the background music, Toca News, Toca Mix, parents' information, the video recording option, and access to shopping for in-app purchases by finding Toca Life: World in their device's settings menu. There's a bit of potty humor: Characters sit (clothed) on a toilet, make poop and fart noises, and flush the toilet. There's also poop in a litter box. Read the developer's privacy policy for details on how your (or your kids') information is collected, used, and shared and any choices you may have in the matter, and note that privacy policies and terms of service frequently change.\n\n",

        "text" : "This seamless collection of locations, objects, and characters for open-ended imaginative play is limited mostly by how much money you want to spend. Toca Life fans will love the opportunity to collect all their worlds in one place. It's easy now to pop into the stable, go on vacation, visit the hairdresser, and stop by the office. There's opportunity here to create a huge, interconnected world -- that is, if you want to pay for it. The free download includes quite a bit of content. And those who've already bought apps in the Toca Life series have even more of a head start. But even so, growing this world requires a bit of an investment, which could make Toca Life World: Build Stories feel like a push to buy, buy, buy. It's important to note that the developer included a way to turn off the shopping icon, which gives parents a great option for avoiding this pitfall. And though it looks great to keep adding to the world, there's actually a good deal of repetition across locations. Sure, there's different scenery and some different objects, but the essence of what's available in the school isn't all that different than what's available in the city, for example. The Toca Life Mix animated stories give kids some inspiration for creating storylines and help support Toca Life World: Build Stories' storytelling potential. The build-your-own sections give kids lots of autonomy to create and take the lead in their play, but also present another area where kids can pay real money to buy more options. Toca Life World: Build Stories shines as a largely flexible platform for imaginative play. It's up to families to decide if this digital space provides as rich an opportunity for pretend play, imagination, and role play as off-screen forms of this most traditional type of play do -- or if they both have a place in their kids' lives.\n\n",
